# Setting up MkDocs in a new repo 

In your repo: 

Add `mkdocs-material-dib` as a submodule:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/dib-lab/mkdocs-material-dib.git
echo "site/" >> .gitignore
```

Commit:

```
git add .gitmodules .gitignore mkdocs-material-dib
git commit -m 'Add mkdocs-material-dib submodule'
```

## Install `mkdocs` and `ghp-import` if necessary:

```
conda install  -c conda-forge mkdocs
conda install -c conda-forge ghp-import
```

## Edit site info and create docs

Grab a `mkdocs.yml` file that you can edit. For example, this is the one for a metatranscriptomics workshop
we taught in Nov 2018. To see what that site looks like, go [here](https://ngs-docs.github.io/2018-cicese-metatranscriptomics).

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ngs-docs/2018-cicese-metatranscriptomics/master/mkdocs.yml
```

Edit the info in `mkdocs.yml` to reflect your repo name and address, color, and sidebar navigation (`nav`). You'll also see that you can change the names for your docs directory and built web pages, but I assume here that they are `docs` and `site`, respectively. 

Make a `docs` directory where you'll add the markdown docs for the website. Add a simple `hello world` or similar md file to start. 

```
mkdir -p docs
echo '# Hello World' > docs/index.md
```

## Deploy the site

Go to `Settings` in your repo, and enable Github Pages for your repository.

In your repo, build the site:
```
mkdocs build
```

View your site locally:
```
mkdocs serve
```

Push your changes to `gh-pages`:
```
ghp-import site -p
```

Check your Github Pages URL for your simple md file:
```
https://<repo-owner>.github.io/<repo-name>
```

Continue to edit your docs, using `mkdocs build` to build the html version of the site, and `ghp-import` to push to `gh-pages`. Voila! 


## The first time you clone a repo with a mkdocs submodule:

(for example, if you set this up on a different computer, but want to edit the docs)

If you want to edit the docs, you'll need to grab the `mkdocs-material-dib` submodule.

If cloning the repo for the first time:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/<repo-owner>/<repo-name>.git
```
`recursive` will pull the submodule as well as the main git repo.


If you already have the repo, and need to pull in the submodule:

```
git submodule update --init
```

## Setting up automatic deploys with GitHub Actions

See an example in the the [Speeding Up Science](https://github.com/speeding-up-science-workshops/speeding-up-science-workshops.github.io/tree/source/.github/workflows) repo.
- `ci.yml` defines the workflow that runs on every PR, and checks if there are no errors during the `mkdocs build` process.
- `build_docs.yml` defines an extra deploy step using [actions-gh-pages](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages)
  for deploys to the `master` branch (the GitHub Pages branch for this repo). You need to set up a deploy key and ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY in secrets to be able to do
  that, follow instructions in the [actions-gh-pages README](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages/blob/master/README.md#getting-started) for more info.
