The goal of these workshops is to \u201creverse engineer\u201d common data visualization approaches used for biological data analysis and commonly published in scientific journal articles (heatmaps, read/OTU summaries, etc.). Workshop goals/products include: Compile reproducible code workflows for the three common environmental -Omics approaches (metabarcoding, metagenomics, or metatranscriptomics). Jupyter notebooks will contain functional code and customizable parameters (with documentation/explanation) that users can adapt and deploy on their own data sets, assuming import of \u201cstandard\u201d data formats that are typically generated during standard -Omics pipelines (e.g. FASTQ files of reads/contigs, OTU tables for metabarcoding). Gather information from end users in the life sciences about their computational needs and ongoing challenges. Where do the gaps exist in terms of your data analysis needs? Where do existing tools, pipelines, tutorials and trainings fall short? Lay the foundations for new open-source online lessons focused on \u201canalyze your own data\u201d training (where participants come to a workshop to specifically learn to analyze their own in-hand environmental -Omics datasets). The first workshop happedn May 8-10, 2019 at UC Davis, and produced a number of analysis and visualization notebooks for metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabarcoding.

However, if you already have the repo, you'll want to pull down submodule like this: git submodule update --init Installing the tools \u00b6 We recommend conda for tool installation. conda install -c conda-forge mkdocs conda install -c conda-forge ghp-import Where are the docs? \u00b6 Each page on the website is a markdown document in the docs folder. These are organized by the navigation ( nav ) text in the mkdocs.yml file, which sits in the main directory. By looking at the mkdocs.yml file, you can find the name of the markdown file you want to edit. Updating an Existing Page \u00b6 If you're updating a file that already exists, start by making edits to the appropriate markdown file. Then, you'll want to check that the markdown you wrote will be rendered properly. Assuming you've installed mkdocs (above), you build the markdown into html like so: mkdocs build And then build a local site like so: mkdocs serve The site will now be rendered on your local computer (viewable in your web browser at the link that will come up on your screen with a successful mkdocs serve , like http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ) and you can continue to make changes to your md file until it looks right. Stop the mkdocs serve by using Ctrl-C . Note, if you're embedding images into your markdown, please name them appropriately (preferably including the name of your markdown file, e.g. XY-workflow-img1.png ) and place them into the docs/img folder. This will keep our docs folder nice and clean.
