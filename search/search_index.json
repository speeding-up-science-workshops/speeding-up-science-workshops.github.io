These are organized by the navigation ( nav ) text in the mkdocs.yml file, which sits in the main directory. By looking at the mkdocs.yml file, you can find the name of the markdown file you want to edit. Updating an Existing Page \u00b6 If you're updating a file that already exists, start by making edits to the appropriate markdown file. Then, you'll want to check that the markdown you wrote will be rendered properly. Assuming you've installed mkdocs (above), you build the markdown into html like so: mkdocs build And then build a local site like so: mkdocs serve The site will now be rendered on your local computer (viewable in your web browser at the link that will come up on your screen with a successful mkdocs serve , like http://127.0.0.1:8000/ ) and you can continue to make changes to your md file until it looks right. Stop the mkdocs serve by using Ctrl-C . Note, if you're embedding images into your markdown, please name them appropriately (preferably including the name of your markdown file, e.g. XY-workflow-img1.png ) and place them into the docs/img folder. This will keep our docs folder nice and clean. When you're finished, commit your changes as you normally would, e.g.: git add <myfile.md> git commit -m \"some useful commit message\" The repository is set up to use GitHub Actions to build the docs and upload to the right branch. Adding a New Page \u00b6 If you want to add a new page, you'll need to add that file to the file navigation in the mkdocs.yml file.

This repository contains codes to make heatmap and stacked bar plots for metatranscriptomic function and RNA-based taxonomy summaries. The demonstration shown here is using data from this paper by Michael D. Lee . Quick Start \u00b6 Once the is started, user will enter a virtual Rstudio interface. User can either excute the codes with included samples by clicking on the \"function-summary.Rmd\" and \"taxa-summary.rmd\" scripts or upload new data files by clicking the Upload button at the lower right panel. To save a rendered html output, user can click the knitr button at the upper left panel. Example Input \u00b6 1.

This repository contains codes to plot and calculate correlation (linear regression) between metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing results acquired from the same sample. There is an example of visualizing gene abundances (DNA) compared to their expression levels (RNA) included in the binder. The data are from one Mediterranean site from the TARA Oceans project (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6237/1261359.long). The metagenomics come from sample accession SAMEA2619782, and the metatransciptomics come from SAMEA2619784. Quick Start \u00b6 Click the jupyter notebook file (Correlation_dna_rna.ipynb) to enter the interactive user interface. You can either run the notebook with the included example or upload new data files by clicking the Upload button at the upper right corner of the binder homepage. See below for examples of input files. The code chunks can be excuted by pressing Ctrl + Enter , or click the Run button on top of the notebook. Example Input \u00b6 1. A count table containing genes found in both DNA and RNA sequencing results. \u00b6 Gene DNA RNA 0 TOBG-MED-1076_1101 3.57863 12.9926 1 TOBG-MED-1076_1116 0.71486 4.03726 2 TOBG-MED-1076_1131 7.72704 5.45492 3 TOBG-MED-1076_1151 2.85944 15.5723 4 TOBG-MED-1076_1195 8.81305 12.3797 2. An annotation table. If a gene has \"nan\" value for KO ID, this means that this gene does not have any match within the KEGG database. These \"nan\" values will be removed. \u00b6 Gene KO_ID 0 TOBG-MED-1076_1019 nan 1 TOBG-MED-1076_1027 nan 2 TOBG-MED-1076_1028 K04084 3 TOBG-MED-1076_1032 nan 4 TOBG-MED-1076_1038 K05540 3. A KEGG Orthology table. Each KO ID may belong to multiple pathways. Therefore, the user will need to manually curate this table. \u00b6 KO_ID Category1 0 K00360 Nitrogen metabolism 1 K00362 Nitrogen metabolism 2 K00363 Nitrogen metabolism 3 K00366 Nitrogen metabolism 4 K00367 Nitrogen metabolism Example Output \u00b6 The figure below is a static example of the output figure.
